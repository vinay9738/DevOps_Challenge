AWS cloud formation service helps in simplifying the provisioning and management to deploy Infrastructure in AWS cloud. 
In the attached script, I have written a script to deploy the database and web server where the applications can be deployed using a Jenkins CI/CD pipeline. Uploading this script in AWS cloudformation section which creates the infrastructure in a mean time.
To create Kubernetes clusters and Nodes, I will be using Kubectl command which helps to deploy the applications in the clusters.
