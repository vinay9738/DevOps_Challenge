# DevOps_Problem_Statement

Problem - 1

A 3 tier environment is a common setup. Use a tool of your choosing/familiarity create these resources. Please remember we will not be judged on the outcome but more focusing on the approach, style and reproducibility

Problem - 2

We need to write code that will query the meta data of an instance within aws and provide a json formatted output. The choice of language and implementation is up to you.

Problem - 3

We have a nested object, we would like a function that you pass in the object and a key and get back the value. How this is implemented is up to you.

Example Inputs

object = {“a”:{“b”:{“c”:”d”}}}
key = a/b/c

object = {“x”:{“y”:{“z”:”a”}}}
key = x/y/z
value = a
